# Hi, I'm Mindi!

I am a wife, a mother, a friend, and a design and fashion enthusiast (among other things). I moved into my husband's childhood home in 2011. It had not been updated since, well...ever.  The challenges I had transforming it into our own home became an opportunity that turned into a calling.

I have been helping clients decorate since 2015 and in real estate and remodeling since 2016. I am fantastic at seeing the potential in any home. Whatever your needs are, I'm your "home" girl.
