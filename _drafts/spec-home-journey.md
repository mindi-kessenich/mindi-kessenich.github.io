Spec Home Journey

SPEC.U.LATIVE: of, relating to, or being a financial speculation.

A spec home is a speculative venture for the builder (or in many

cases, investor), meaning it was built with the intention of

selling it for a profit, as-is or with minimal changes.

I have been given countless opportunities since joining Property

Revival Realty in 2016. That’s a blog within itself. My favorite

one, (I think, don’t quote me, haha) is the opportunity I’ve had

designing and building spec homes. I get asked all the time

what a spec home is. I give them the definition above and then

they ask me if it it’s worth the financial risk. This is what I

always tell people..."You will make more money on a spec home

than I will." I don’t build them solely for the profit like most

investors do. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t take the risk for

free, but I am in it to create beautiful homes, over more profit.

The builder we use knows enough now to up my budgets from

his other investors because the details are important to me and

I refuse to have a single boob light in my new builds!

When I became a Realtor, I quickly learned the value in

investing in real estate. It’s a no brainer! I had become a

landlord by means of desperation years before, and really had

no interest in managing more rental properties. The other

options were to build a spec home or do a flip. Flips have been

nearly non-existent in the last several years, so I asked one of

the founders of Property Revival and he offered a partnership

in a spec without a blink of the eye. That opportunity was

multi-faceted. It was an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of

new builds; the contract side of them, what things cost and

how to figure out margins, it satisfied a dream I always had of

building my own home (until I had to hand it over, haha!), it

was an opportunity to market myself, build my portfolio, meet

people, make connections and learn about our design center:

Artisol, and so on. It also provided an opportunity to make

some extra money.

The day that I sat in a room with a draftsman and began

redrawing the floor plan of our future spec home, was one of

the best days ever. It cost us about $2400 to purchase the plan

because by the time I was done with it, he considered it a

complete redraw. Well worth it. We have already built two

fantastic homes with that plan and they both had accepted

offers before the drywall phase was finished. I just had a walk

through with the buyers of our second home and they gave us

so many compliments on our plan. I told them the reason it felt

different is because so much thought went into the design of

the floor plan. I was designing my dream home! For someone

else! ;) This step is not something you have to do to build a spec

home though. You can hire a builder to build a home he has

built several times. He will recommend a house where he has

his numbers so dialed in, you know (more closely) what to

expect for profit assuming you sell the home for the projected

list price.

The other reason you will make more than I will if you build a

spec home, is that most investors do not make the selections

for the home. I am a hybrid between buyers and investors. You

see, most investors in our company rely on the expertise of our

on staff interior designer. THEY are so smart! She has excellent

taste and you can rest assured that while you are out doing

your thang, she is creating a beautiful sellable home for you to

make some money on. Not me! I want to make ALL of the

selections and guess what, I’m never on budget. So, we make

less and I spend a LOT more time. And time is money, folks.

Especially in real estate!

The why behind my spec home investments is bigger than

most. But that’s just me! Building a spec home just to make

money is totally justifiable and the reason most (ALL, except for

me. Wink wink) investors do it. It’s a great option if you have

cash to leverage. It requires a down payment just like any other

loan, but you can (in a good market! Nothing is guaranteed!!)

make more money in less time than other investment options.

Whether you are thinking of building a speculative home as an

investment or you are looking for someone to help you build

YOUR dream home, I can help!!

Designing and redesigning spaces is my favorite thing to do.

Buy, sell, build, remodel, redecorate...I’m your girl.
